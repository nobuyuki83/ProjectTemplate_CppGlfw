# Project Template for Cpp & GLFW

## How to set up GLFW

Namely, you can set up GLFW in three ways  
- download `glfw` using package manager (for Mac and Ubuntu)
- download pre-build library
- compile the GLFW source code by yourself

Following, we discuss these option in detail 

---- 

- for Mac, install `glfw` using package manager `brew` as
```bash
$ brew install glfw
```
For ubuntu, install `glfw` using `apt-get` as

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev xorg-dev \
                          libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev \
                          libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libglew-dev
```
Unfortunately, for windows, there is not a easyway to install `glfw` with commands.

---

- You can download the prebuild library from here: https://www.glfw.org/download.html . 
Extract the compressed file and rename it as `GLFW_Lib` and put it under the `3rd_party/` folder of the repository.

---
- alternatively you can build `glfw` from source code and put the library under `3rd_party/` with

```bash
$ mkdir 3rd_party/GLFW_Lib 
$ git submodule update --init 3rd_party/glfw
$ cd 3rd_party/glfw
$ cmake .
$ cmake --build . --config Release
$ cmake --install . --prefix ../GLFW_Lib 
```
